## Solution
On website is running quiz, it seems that respond to all questions right gives the answer. Unfortunately if you replied wrong, you won't notice until end of quiz. Also after several runs of quiz I've notice that:

- questions are still the same
- wrong answers are probably good answers for some other question. This can lead to some confusions, for example there are several base64 strings, in some are encoded sama java things, power shell scripts and so on, so base64 string answer maybe it's not the good one
- this is a very good page for finding a lot of answers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures

So, playing for a while, find out correct answers and result is:
